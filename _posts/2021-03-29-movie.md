## Exploratory Data analysis

### Summary
What contributes to the success of movies in terms of profit? Is it budget? The genre? The season it was released?

The success of movies project was my first data science project where I applied one component of the data science process, statistical analysis. This analysis was also conducted entirely in the R programming language. This project allowed me create graphs in R and learn how to interpret those statistical graphs. I also attempted my first linear and multiple regression models to see if I could predict the success of a movie by predicting its profit.

### Highlights
* Filtering data in R
* Summary statistics
* Scatter plots
* Q-Q plots
* Correlation
* Regression

### Project Preview
```
ggplot(moviesdf, aes(x = budget, y = profit)) + geom_point(position = "jitter", color = "dark blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  labs(x = "Budget", y = "Profit", title = "Movies: Budget vs Profit")
```
