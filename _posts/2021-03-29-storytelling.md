## Data Visualization

### Summary
Data presentation is about storytelling. Knowing who your audience is can shape the way you present your data and the story that is told. Some ways to tell your story with data can be done through highlighting segments of a graph, utilizing color, textures, and text size to name a few methods. These techniques are explored in this project.

The examples here took the scenario that airlines are a safe way to travel by comparing airline safety data from 1985-2014 with supplementing support of car accident data and airline passenger data. The complete project showcases the storytelling of this data through a presentation intended towards a internal audience and a infographic intended towards an external audience.

### Techniques
* Basic graphs are created using the library matplotlib in Python
* Graphs are exported from python and through a vector graphics software, Inkscape, the graphs are transformed to the final product, bringing the storytelling piece together

### Before Example
The skeleton of the graph is created in python.

#### Finalized Example
The finalized version is transformed in graphics software to highlight the sections of the graph that extends above a specific threshold. Text placed on the graph is used to emphasize quantity from the y-axis.
