## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Summary
This project used exploratory data analysis techniques in Python to prove or disprove a hypothesis based on female exercise behavior with those who have kids under the age of 18 based on a survey of time usage.

### Hypothesis
Women who have children under the age of 18 exercise less than women who do not have children under the age of 18.

### Techniques
* Histograms
* Scatter plots
* Descriptive statistics
* Outlier detection
* Probability mass function
* Cumulative distribution function
* Correlation
* Permutation test
* Regression

### Results
Through this statistical analysis and the use of CDF, hypothesis testing, and simple regression, I was able to conclude the null hypothesis being statistically significant. The null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative was accepted: females with children exercise less than those that do not have children. However, this conclusion is limited to the data being collected for only females who recorded that they participated in any sort of exercise in the time use survey. It does not include females that did not exercise at all.
