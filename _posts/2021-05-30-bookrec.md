## Recommender Systems

### Summary
Can books be recommended to a user based on a description of a book and from similar readers?

People can have a range of tastes in books they like to read or stick to the same types of genres or plots. There are many ways to find exposure to books such as browsing a bookstore aisle, following favorite authors, joining book clubs. For those that haven’t read in a long time, finding a new book might be difficult, but they may have that one book they liked in the past. For others, the books on their to-be-read list are endless and are always looking for recommendations or scouring what to read.

Descriptions of books that appear on the back, inside flap jacket, or online are usually read to determine if the reader wants to continue with the story presented. It contains a short description of what the book is about. Given one description of a book a user really liked reading, can a system be created to find a similar matching description of a different book to recommend? In addition to finding similar styles of books the user enjoys, can a system also be created that recommends books that others have enjoyed reading, that the user might enjoy reading as well?

Two book recommendations systems were created. A content-based book recommender system that compares author and description to recommend books and a collaborative-filtering book recommender system that takes the user’s ratings of books and gives recommendations based off of users that have rated books similarly to them.

#### Content-Based Recommender System

A content-based recommender system was created to recommend books based off the author and the description of the book. The description text was cleaned, utilized the library Rake to find key phrases in the description. From here, count vectorizer was used to create a matrix counting the frequency of each word. Cosine-similarity was used to find the distance between each vector to find similar books.

The recommender function returned the top 10 similar books to the input book title.

By feeding the book "Jemima J" into the system, it recommended a book I had read before, "Something Blue."

By feeding "The Walking Dead, Vol. 7: The Calm Before" in the system, it recommended 3 other The Walking Dead books. After looking up the description of 4th book it recommended, Alas, Babylon has similar themes to The Walking Dead such as "apocalyptical" and "surviving."

#### Collaborative Filtering Recommender System: User-Based

The collaborative filtering model was created to recommend books to users based on their ratings of books compared to other users of ratings on books. If two users liked and rated the same book the same, then books from user 2 was recommended to user 1. The system was created using the Surprise library in Python. SVD algorithm was chosen as it resulted in the best RMSE score of 0.8769 and MAE score of 0.6961 compared to 4 other algorithms tested through cross validation. The model was trained on the data using 10 factors and 50 epochs.

When feeding my personal Goodreads data into the recommender system, the following top 10 books were recommended with their score that the system thought I would rate the book as.


|   Rank | Title                                                                   |   Score |
